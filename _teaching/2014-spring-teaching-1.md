***Course Description*** 

Econometrics is the development and application of statistical techniques for the measurement of economic phenomena. This course is your initial study of econometric theory and practice. Topics include: translation of economic theory into statistical models, statistical foundations of econometrics, preregression analysis bivariate and multiple regression techniques, hypothesis testing, multicollinearity, specification error, autocorrelation, errors in variables, identification, and simultaneous estimation. The writing assignments and the final paper will provide you an opportunity to formulate an economic model, estimate the model with appropriate data, and interpret the results. This experience will help you understand how econometrics relates to other upper-level economics courses which focus on theoretical models for how the world operates. Econometrics provides a method of testing the validity of these economic models, and the term paper will improve your writing skills, giving you a chance to write clearly and concisely about technical material.
