**Abstract**

Implicit in the prices of financial options are Arrow-Debreu prices and their continuous state-price equivalent, the risk-neutral probability density function (PDF). Intuitively, the probability represents the market's “belief” in the distribution of future prices of an underlying security. Furthermore, the risk-neutral density evolves over time, becoming more concentrated as an option approaches maturity. At expiration the measure is a single point. In this paper, we quantify the evolution of the density function using information theoretic concepts. We propose an estimator of the density which does not bias the measurement as an alternative to standard nonparametric approaches. We estimate the density for options with the same expiration date, and compute measures of information. Parametric analysis shows the majority of the information in our density accrues near maturity according to a logarithmic or power law. No existing theoretical model describes this process.
