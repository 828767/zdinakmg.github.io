excerpt: **Job Market Paper**. We introduce a new high-frequency analysis of options written on the S&P 500, and quantify in real-time the information contained in the probability measure implied by option prices. We find the intraday flow of information summarizing the expected future price of the index is not continuous, and often increases in discrete intervals. This fact is used to identify large-information events over the six years in our sample.

**Abstract**

This article introduces a new high-frequency analysis of six years of data for options written on the S&P 500 and traded on the Chicago Board of Exchange. We quantify in real-time the information contained in the probability measure implied by option prices, using concepts developed in information theory. Here information is analogous to a reduction in uncertainty surrounding the future price of the underlying security. A simple nonparametric estimator allows us to measure the amount of information gained as an option approaches maturity. We then test for jumps in the expectation of said future price. We find the intraday flow of information in a large and important market is not continuous, and often increases in discrete intervals. This fact is used to identify events in which a large amount of information is revealed to investors.
