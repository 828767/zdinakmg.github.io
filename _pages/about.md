I'm a PhD Candidate in Economics at Washington University in St. Louis. My interests lie in econometrics, statistics, economics and finance. In broad terms, my research investigates how financial markets update information.

Before graduate school, I was a Research Assistance at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, where I worked in the Division of International Finance; and before that, an intern at both BMW Group and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
