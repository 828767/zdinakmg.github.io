Welcome

I'm a PhD Candidate in Economics at Washington University in St. Louis. In broad terms, my research investigates how financial markets update information. 

My job market paper models the evolution of the density function implied by option prices at a high frequency. Intuitively, this probability represents the market’s belief in the distribution of the future price of an underlying security. As this density evolves over time, it becomes more and more concentrated. At expiration, the measure collapses to a single point. 
I use econometric and information theoretic concepts to quantify the gain in information this process represents over the option’s life-cycle. The research has implication for asset pricing and risk management.
